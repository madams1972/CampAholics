  ,"audioDescription":"The backcountry camping trail is located directly in the dunefield, surrounded by white sand dunes that can be as tall as 36 feet. Two separate mountain ranges are visible to the east and west. Ten campsites are spread out over the entirety of the two-mile loop trail, and are marked by brown wooden posts that emerge straight up from the ground. Fixed to these posts are small square signs with campsite numbers ranging from 1-10, arrows pointing in the direction of each site, and a small brown square showing two white silhouettes of gender-neutral hikers with walking sticks and backpacks. The sites themselves are located in the inner dune areas, which are the flat low points between dunes. The ground here is hard-packed, firmer, and often slightly darker than the soft white sand found in the dunes themselves. In some of the sites and along parts of the trail, you can find bushels of varying types of grasses, which tend to be around 1-2 feet tall and dark green and tan in color. There may also be other types of vegetation along the trail and in the campsites, including the soaptree yucca. Depending on the season, the yucca have two main components: their bayonet leaves, which are dark green, about an inch wide, and sharp enough at the tips to warrant their name; and the stem, which is a tall, woody feature that stands vertically from the base and is often over five feet tall. When a stem is present, many creamy white flowers rest on its tip. The flower petals harden after they bloom in late spring, and transform into firm capsules that house the yucca’s dark brown, round seeds. Each site is marked by a bright orange post that protrudes from the ground, with the site number on it."

The campground loop is gravel with slight inclines although vehicles with 4-wheel drive or high clearance are generally not required. There are 22 full hook-up sites (water, sewer, 30 AMP) that can accommodate RV’s up to 50 foot long. The dry camping area consists of 3 separate loops (A-C) that have 80 concrete padded sites that can accommodate tent, trailers and RV’s. Each loop road is asphalt so 4-wheel drive or high clearance vehicle are not required. There are slight inclines in the road, but the Individual sites are mostly level with a paved driveway and gravel tent pad (may be challenging for wheelchairs). Each site has a charcoal grill and picnic table but because the sites are gravel and, possibly on an incline, maneuvering a wheelchair may be difficult. In the center of the campground (approximate 5 minute walk from furthest site) are accessible restrooms with flush toilets, sinks and showers. Pets are allowed as long as they are on a leash and under control at all times. Please call the Lake Powell Resorts and Marinas at 435-684-3032 for more information."

  ,"audioDescription":"Over 2 million visitors annually come to enjoy the scenic beauty of Cades Cove and its many historic structures. Popular activities here include hiking, biking, touring the 11-mile Cades Cove Loop Road and observing wildlife. Whether blanketed in bright wildflowers in the spring or vivid colors in the fall, the scenery at Cades Cove never disappoints. Cades Cove is a broad, verdant valley surrounded by mountains and is one of the most popular destinations within Great Smoky Mountains National Park. It offers some of the best opportunities for wildlife viewing in the park. Large numbers of white-tailed deer are frequently seen, and sightings of black bear, coyote, groundhog, turkey, raccoon, skunk, and other animals are also possible. For hundreds of years Cherokee Indians hunted in Cades Cove, but archeologists have found no evidence of major settlements. The first Europeans settled in the cove sometime between 1818 and 1821. By 1830 the population of the area had already swelled to 271. Cades Cove Campground is open-year round and combines the feel of primitive camping with the modern convenience of flush toilets and drinking water. During peak season (May - October) a camp store provides visitors with basic necessities as well as bike rentals. Events like Interpretive Programs in the nearby amphitheater and Bicycle Only Days on the loop road provide visitors with a fun and unique experience.

The camp offers 92 individual sites, all with grills, tables and campfire rings, perfect for a meal or a late-night s'mores session. Hookups and showers are not provided, but flush toilets and drinking water are available. Deep Creek is in the southeastern portion of the park and provides a moderate climate, typified by mild winters and hot, humid summers. Because of its proximity to water, Deep Creek is an ideal campground for water recreation and books up quickly during summer months. Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a hiker's paradise, with plenty of trails easily accessible from the Deep Creek campsites. An easy 1.6 mile roundtrip hike will allow you to enjoy two beautiful waterfalls in the Deep Creek area. Walk Deep Creek Trail 0.7 mile to the junction with Indian Creek Trail. On your way you can view elegant Tom Branch Falls located on the far side of Deep Creek. Turn right at the junction with Indian Creek Trail and proceed approximately 200' to Indian Creek Falls. The falls are 25 feet in height. Deep Creek runs on the edge of the campground and provides easily accessible fishing, wading and tubing. Visitors can also enjoy high-quality backcountry fishing in the cool waters of the countless streams and rivers that snake through the mountains, with trout available in abundance."

  ,"weatherOverview":"Late spring and early summer are the driest times of the year, with relative humidity often falling below 10% during the day. Early July through September is the the “monsoon” season. Strong ground-level heating creates updrafts of warm air, which produce powerful thunderstorms whenever there is sufficient moisture. Nights begin to get cooler in late August and early September. Winter precipitation usually falls as snow on the rims, however, Desert View campground is closed during winter months."

At the beginning of the Flamingo campground and looking west, there is a white registration office located in the median between the incoming and outgoing paved campground lanes. From here, the campground is separated into two loops with road access encircling the campsites of each. Following a right turn to the northwest after the registration office, you are taken to T-Loop which is available for RV and tent camping with multiple pull-through style campsites. Trash receptacles are in the center median as you enter this loop following the one-way road to the right. Many sites in this area have electricity and water. Two shower and restroom facilities are in the loop area. The first one has a water source and a sanitary pump-out station for RVs. Some sites have shade trees. A campground host is located at site number 16. If following the road straight to the west from the registration office, A-Loop will be entered which is a tent camping only area. The one-way loop will take you past turn outs for vehicles and campsites. Some sites have shade trees. Two facilities provide showers and restrooms, the first one has a water source and sanitary pump-out station. Most of the campsites in these two loops have picnic table and fire ring access. Additional sites can be found by following the outbound lane from the registration office. By taking an immediate right turn to the southeast, the ECO Tent area will be on the right between the road and Florida Bay connected by a series of slightly elevated walkways. These tan enclosed canvas-like structures are often available in a furnished condition with each having electricity and a fan. Some Eco Tents are wheelchair accessible. Restrooms and water are available at a facility close to the Eco Tents walkway access. Continuing past the Eco Tents towards the east and located on the right is a low-lying grassy area with some fire rings and picnic tables. This is the walk-in tent camping and group site area located between the road and Florida Bay. This area does not have shade available. The restroom and water source facility is located just past the area where the road ends in a loop to take you back towards the registration office and main park road. Parking is available at all loop individual campsites whereas the Eco Tent and walk-in area have small parking lots along the road."

Across the moat from the fort is an open field and approaching the grassy campground, the groups site is indicated by a sign and a grouping of gray picnic tables and black grills. Continuing south west, smaller campsites are indicated by a picnic table, grill and 6 foot wooden pole with several hooks for hanging food and other camping materials. Wide leafed sea grape trees, palm trees and button wood trees offer sun and wind protection over small sandy patches in the grass where tents can be erected. Continuing southwest through the campground and towards the coaling dock platform, a sandy path winds around campsite, palm trees and ends at the bathroom facility. The bathrooms are located in a brown, square, wooden building up a gradual inclined ramp with thick black tap to prevent slipping. Two adjacent doors each lead to vaulted toilets. Leaving the restroom a series of signs to the left highlight interpretive information and indicate a short route to a sandy beach. Walking along the white sandy path there are small succulent green plants covering the ground of the remining camp area. Here, there white sand and waves crashing along the moat wall. Following the beach back to the fort, the campground area again comes into view as you circle back to the docks."

  ,"audioDescription":"This prominent island, also affectionately known and referred to by locals as Jake’s Island, is a remnant of large emergent sandbars that later developed into successional forests and sand flats. Today the 800-acre property supports a wide variety of wildlife on its sandbars and within its dense forested areas of cottonwood and Eastern red-cedar. Chutes paralleling the island, free-flowing water, vegetation, and sandbars not only provide important wildlife habitat, but add to the aesthetic qualities of the Park’s 59-Mile District. Situated along the Missouri National Recreational River Water Trail, the island is between Nebraska and South Dakota."

Access to the island trail is only by boat; land access is by taking the Yankton City Forest trail. Green Island has undergone quite a change. A backwater was restored as a mitigation measure during the construction of the Discovery Bridge. In 2008, the backwater was connected to the main river channel on the downstream end. The flood of 2011 eroded the upstream end of the backwater, creating an island with a flowering side channel."

  ,"audioDescription":"The Gulpha Gorge campground is located between Gulpha Creek and Highway 7-South. The campground road is essentially a big loop connecting all the amenities and facilities of the campground together. There are tall trees that fill the spaces between the campgrounds and create a remote-feeling atmosphere. As you enter, the picnic area is immediately available on the left. There are stone tables/benches with free standing grills available. The picnic area overlooks Gulpha Creek and is very shady. Driving through the campground, you'll first see the dump station, the campground hosts campsites, and then will drive through several campsites on the loop. At the end of the loop is the campground's amphitheater. The amphitheater is sloped downward, with a stage and A-frame structure at the bottom. There are many rows with benches, separated by wide-aisles leading down to the stage. Behind the amphitheater is Gulpha Creek and the access point for Gulpha Gorge trail. Leaving the amphitheater, you'll drive by more campsites, Gulpha Creek is now on the right hand side, and eventually will come to the fee station. This is a ranch style building, with ornamental bushes in front, that has maps, brochures, park information, and the fee station to pay for your campsite. Continuing down the road, you'll drive through the rest of the campsites, and eventually will reconnect with the entrance road, passing the picnic area on the right-hand side before getting to Highway 7 South."

  ,"audioDescription":"Juniper Family Campground is located on the mesa above Frijoles Canyon, where the main archaeological sites are found. There are 3 loops in the campground named for local wildlife: Abert's Squirrel Loop, Black Bear Loop, and Coyote Loop. The campground is located in the pinyon-juniper woodland which means there is minimal shade as both of these types of trees are short. An occasional Ponderosa pine towers above the other vegetation providing some shade especially in the Coyote Loop of the campground. The campground is paved and each campground space includes a picnic table and in-ground grill. Each loop also has a restroom facility with a paved walkway leading to it. There are no hookups or showers in the campground but there is a dump station located just adjacent to it."

  ,"audioDescription":"Turning off the main park road to the Long Pine Key day use and camping area, is the pine rockland habitat. Pine rocklands are characterized by tall slash pine trees, with peeling brown bark and high green needles. The ground between the spaced out pine trees is a low lying shrubby mixture of saw palmettos, dense grasses numerous wooded shrubs. Craggy, chalky white limestone characterizes the ground, and can make walking off path difficult. If there has been a fire recently, there can be charred remains of burnt trees and crunch ash on the pineland floor Follow the slowly winding Pinelands road to a forked split to either the campground or a day use area. A slight left will take you to the campground. A white building with a green metallic roof welcomes campers to the Long Pine Key Campground. Behind this entrance station is a small patch of grass containing several garbage receptacles and tall information boards including a map of the campground and interpretive information about fire’s role in the habitat. A red payphone stands next to the information boards. The campground road follows a one-way counter clockwise loop, approximately a mile in length, that is in the shape of an oval. Slash pine trees are the dominant plant species, but a wide variety of small shrubs such as beauty berry and sumac add purple or red to the green foliage. As you follow the road around in a slow arc moving south west, the loop is bisected by alphabetized roads ascending from ‘A’ to ‘K’. Each lettered road has anywhere between 5-7 camping areas. Camping areas include a paved slab for vehicle parking, a mowed lawn area, a circular black metal fire ring with a grill attachment, and a 6 or 8 foot gray picnic table. On alternating lettered roads, the restrooms sit in white buildings with green roofs and have two separate entrances on either side. White cement shower buildings have tall green roofs which are covered by solar panels for water heating. Through the vegetation to the north, there is a large blue human made lake, which surrounds an island with dozens of tall slash pines sitting atop the rocky outcrop. At the loop halfway point lies a small parking area and a paved, lighted walking path leading to an amphitheater. The amphitheater hugs the lakeside shoreline and contains twelve rows of benched seating, bisected by a center aisle. A large white wooden backdrop faces the benches as well as a presentation podium for a speaker. The road begins to circle around the loop and now heads to the northeast. The lettered roads begin to move up from ‘K’ to ‘A’ and there are spaced out camp areas on either side. To the south the Pine Rockland habitat extends for over a mile, with the tall slash pines looming over the campground. Following the road, to its completion the entrance station is approached from the opposite side and you can exit the campground area back to the Long Pine Key Road."

  ,"audioDescription":"NOTE: This campground does not have running water. You must bring enough water for everyone in your party. Water is available at Steel Visitor Center or Mazama Village. Drive three miles south along Pinnacles Road from East Rim Drive. Turn right after the brown metal directional sign announcing the campground. You have arrived at the entrance. Welcoming you is a brown wood sign with the words Lost Creek Campground carved into the panel and painted white. It hangs from a beam leveraged by five round, multi-sized posts that create the sign’s base. Beneath towering lodge pole pines and Shasta Red Firs are grassy meadows with 16 tent sites distributed in an inner and outer circle. An Information bulletin board and pay kiosk is straight ahead. The bulletin board contains information on how to select a site, pay, rules, regulations and any current concerns regarding the campground. From the kiosk, go left towards site #1 and continue as the road winds around to site #4. If your go right, you will by-pass sites 1 through 4, and turn right in front of site 5. Lost Creek runs behind sites 2 thru 5. Wildflowers highlight the area during summer and fall colors resume their brilliance as the weather cools. Between sites 4 and 5 is Greyback Road, the former East Rim Drive. There is a locked metal gate swung across the road to prohibit vehicle traffic. This road is now considered a trail for hikers, bicyclists, and pet walking. Across from sites 4 and 5 is a native stone and wood structure. This restroom is closed due to water rights legislation which does not give the National Park Service senior rights to use of the water in Lost Creek and its reservoir. Instead, there are portable toilets, several which are accessible, stationed alongside the building. Beyond the closed restroom, the road continues in a circular fashion with access to sites 6 to 16. The road and all campsite parking are covered with small crushed gravel-like rock. Tent areas are mostly dirt and natural debris with some crushed rock. All sites are generally level with room to park two vehicles. Each site has one picnic table; bases are white and formed from concrete; tops are made of heavy planks of wood. Most are in the sun with a possibility of shade at times throughout the day. Each site also has one bear-proof, metal food storage locker. The park is home to many animals, including black bears. All of your food, garbage, cooking equipment, storage containers (e.g. ice chests), and toiletries (soaps, toothpaste, etc.) must be kept in your vehicle or in the bear-resistant locker provided at your campsite. There are tree stumps and logs throughout the meadow and around campsites. Many dead trees stand along and beyond the creek. There are trash and recycling containers in several locations in the campground. The creek is closed to fishing to save and protect native bull trout. Since the campground is alongside Pinnacles Road it is not quiet during the day due to cars traveling to and from Pinnacles Overlook. After sunset when vehicle traffic comes to a halt and sunshine shifts to a starlit sky, and again when quiet hours begin at 10 pm, giving way to the sounds of Lost Creek and the wind, that the campground is quiet."

  ,"audioDescription":"Turn right after Annie Creek Entrance Station, onto the main road to Mazama Campground. Stay straight driving past the right turn for the Mazama Village Store. 214 sites are organized on the left-hand side of the road into seven loops lettered A to G, each with a sign identifying the loop location. Travel throughout each loop is one-way in a clockwise direction. At the front of each site is a wooden post with the site number. The sites are dispersed through a forest of lodgepole pines, mountain hemlocks, Shasta red firs, and subalpine firs. Douglas squirrels, gray jays, and Steller’s jays are commonly seen and heard. Each site contains a brown wooden picnic table, a bear-resistant food locker, and a fire ring with a grill. A paved or gravel parking area is provided for cars or an RV. Trash and recycling receptacles are dispersed throughout each loop. The first left turn from the main campground road goes to A-loop with 15 sites including one accessible site, A10. A restroom with running water and flush toilets is near A13, with women on one end of the building and men on the other. A fresh-water spigot is across from the restroom. The second left turn from the main campground road goes to B-loop which has 16 sites including two accessible sites, B1 and B6. There are two restrooms (as previously described) behind sites B5 and B10, and two fresh-water spigots near the restrooms. A right turn at the intersection of loop B goes to the Mazama Village Store, gas pumps, and Annie Creek Restaurant and Gift Shop. The next left is C-loop with 26 sites, two restrooms, and fresh-water spigots at C6 and C19. Directly across from the start of C-loop is the dump station access. Turn right off the main campground road, then take an immediate left to access the dump station. Loop through the dump station area to get back to the main campground road. C-loop is followed by D-loop with 35 sites, one restroom near site D6, and multiple fresh-water spigots throughout the loop. A path between sites D20 and D21 leads to the campground amphitheater. E-loop is the largest loop in the campground with 55 sites, which accommodate tent campers only. There are two restrooms near sites E20 and E47, and multiple fresh-water spigots throughout the loop. Between sites E19 and E21 is a short, gravel access road to the campground amphitheater for park rangers and emergency vehicles, and for visitors walking to or dropping-off. F Loop has 29 sites, and two are accessible, F17 and F21. There is a restroom across from sites F1 and F2, and a restroom with an accessible shower between sites F18 and F22. Multiple fresh-water spigots are located throughout the loop. The end of the main campground road circles through G-loop. This loop has 37 sites with a restroom at the beginning of the loop and multiple fresh-water spigots throughout the loop. From July through early September, rangers present evening programs in the amphitheater, located between D & E loops. There is no parking, including accessible parking, at the amphitheater. Visitors must walk to or be dropped off. Drop-off drivers may use the gravel access road between sites E19 and E21 but cannot park there without the ranger’s permission due to limited space. Unlit walking paths from D & E loop which lead to the front of the outdoor amphitheater are soft soil, not a packed surface. In the amphitheater, lights are on the ground next to the 22 rows of wooden bench seats in three sections from left to right, with wide aisles. Benches face a stage and large movie screen protected within a white structure. There is no designated space for wheelchairs. On the left-hand side of the seating area is a large rock campfire pit, used at the ranger’s discretion. Rangers wear microphones and will try to accommodate any accessible requests brought to their attention. Annie Creek flows through a canyon behind the campground loops and can be heard from several campsites. Annie Creek Trail cuts behind loops C through G with access from the amphitheater or site C11. It is a steep, narrow, dirt path that descends into the canyon following alongside the creek before returning up steep switchbacks."

In the center is a self-pay camping registration board, a vertical box with 54 square sections in six horizontal rows. Each square is numbered and corresponds to an individual campsite. Each row is covered by a hard, clear plastic strip with slots for dropping registration payment receipts into individual squares. To the left of the registration board is a brown box with a lid holding campground registration envelopes. A 3-foot-tall cannister for depositing payment envelopes stands in front of and to the left of the board. It has a slot at the top for slipping in the envelope. Posted to the left of the registration board is payment information and campground registration instructions, along with a site map of the campground. Above the board a notice reads, Firewood not available in campground. Purchase outside of park. To the right of the board are campground regulations and a tide chart. A recycle bin and garbage dumpsters are to the right of the kiosk on a gravel surface. To the left of the kiosk, a concrete sidewalk leads to a wide patio area with a white, rectangular restroom building with a blue metal roof. The women’s room is on the left short side of the building, and the men’s room is on the right front side of the building. Across the sidewalk from the women’s room is a square, 3-foot-tall stone water station. It’s two spigots face the restroom. A sign on top reads, no dishwashing. The sidewalk loops in front of the water station and leads back to the road. Be advised. The concrete sidewalk ends after about 20 feet, transitioning to gravel, then asphalt. In places along the asphalt section, cracks and frost heaves create an uneven surface."

In the center of the loop is an island with low growing plants, a large pine tree, a brown metal food storage locker, a bulletin board, and payment canister. The bulletin board is roof covered and has posted notices on both sides. The side facing the entrance road includes information about day hikes at Quinault; wildlife, food, and your safety; stock use; river crossings; pet regulations; firearms and weapons; and cougars in the area. On the opposite side is a box with a lid holding camping permits. Posted above are campground registration instructions and payment instructions. Other notices include campground and fishing regulations, nearest services, how to help preserve your park, and to contact a park ranger or dial 911 in an emergency. On the food storage locker behind the bulletin board a sign reads: Shared food storage for walk-in sites or campers with no vehicles. Place all food and scented items in locker anytime they are not in use. Please do not use for garbage. Thank you. Campsite surfaces are flat and mostly grass and dirt. Each site has a picnic table and in-ground metal fire pit. The sites are nestled in a forest of young and old pine trees. Fallen trees, covered with green moss, lay on a dense carpet of tall ferns and other low growing plants."

Enter the campground off of State Route 123 and follow the road to the right (a turn off to the left leads to maintenance facilities and staff housing). The main campground road curves through the forest and reaches the visitor center on the right. The Ohanapecosh Visitor Center is a low building with an angled roof tucked among the trees. A small parking lot is in front of the building with a concrete walkway leading to the building's entrance, with restrooms located to the right of the door. In front of the visitor center parking area is an information kiosk with campground information and a place to register for a site. Across the road from the visitor center is Loop A. As you drive down the Loop A road, additional parking is to the left, with picnic tables and a restroom. From the visitor center continue on the main campground road. Loop B starts on the right, with additional day use parking and access to the Silver Falls Trail and the Hot Springs Nature Loop Trail. Loop C is on the left, with walk-in sites and an additional picnic area next to the Ohanapecosh River. Continuing past Loops B and C and the road crosses over the Ohanapecosh River on a concrete bridge. The river is bordered by forest and large rocks and is often a rich deep blue-green color. Past the bridge, there is additional parking along the road on the right with paved paths providing access to the campground amphitheater and the other end of the Silver Falls Trail. Loop D starts on the left. Past Loop D, the main road splits, with Loop F on the left, Loop E on the right. Continue straight to access Loop H on the right and finally Loop G at the end of the road, curving off to the left. Each loop has a restroom facility."

  ,"audioDescription":"A narrow trail, flanked by dry grasses and giant yellow coreopsis plants with thick branches topped with tufts of feathery green leaves and yellow, daisy-like flowers in springtime, and a shaggy, brittle, brown mop of dead leaves in the drier seasons, leads to the San Miguel campground. Perched on a plateau, the campground offers incredible views of the ocean to the north and, in good weather, of Santa Rosa to the northeast. If you are standing at campground, Cuyler Harbor Beach is a mile to the north, by trail. The ranger station is about half a mile away to the southwest. The Lester Ranch site is about halfway along that trail. To the west, in the distance, is Green Mountain. At the campground, there are nine, slatted wooden U-shaped fences or windbreaks that stand about five feet tall. A metal storage box on legs is positioned in a corner of each windbreak. A wooden and metal picnic table is adjacent to each campsite. A wooden restroom building is at the south end of the campsite. It is about 5 feet by 6 feet, with a shingled roof, a lockable door, and a single pit toilet inside. The sign on the door shows symbols for a man and a woman. On the exterior, attached to one side, is a low box with a hinged lid. On another side of the building is a bulletin board with updateable information posted behind glass. On the fourth side of the building is a panel of regulations titled “San Miguel Island Campground” with its own, separate audio description."

In the spring and early summer, the grass is green, the shrub brushes are generally grey-green in color, and the thick branches of the coreopsis are topped with tufts of feathery bright green leaves and yellow daisy-like flowers. In late summer and fall, the grass is brown, the brush looks brown and brittle, and the branches of the coreopsis are brown with shaggy dark brown tufts at the tips. A dirt and gravel trail through the camping area connects ten sites, each with a picnic table and a metal food storage box. If you stand at the edge of the campsite at the cliff facing the ocean, the Landing Cove is visible in the distance to the left or north, cut into the base of a steep cliff."

  ,"audioDescription":"You are standing in the campground, near the wide mouth of a canyon. The campground is in a field of grass, nestled between two hills dotted with scrubby shrubs. At the southern edge of the campground is a creek that runs at the base of the canyon. A distant view of the ocean can be seen beyond the mouth of the canyon. At the lowest part of the campground, if you are facing up-canyon, the restroom building is on your right. A short cement sidewalk leads up toward this single-story wooden building with a gabled, or simple peaked, roof. The roof has two solar panels on the roof. One is a solar hot water panel—a grey metal box, about one foot high, with two pipes attached, one with a spigot. The other is a photovoltaic panel, only about 2 inches high. The building has reddish brown, horizontal, wood plank siding. A shallow porch, with railings, wraps around two sides of the building, covered by a roof overhand, supported by posts and beams. You can access the porch two ways. On the building’s left side is a handicapped accessible ramp. The front side of the building has stairs with railings and five risers. On the ground next to the stairs is a metal box with two thick brushes that face inward. On the front side, the porch has a bulletin board on the wall, flanked by doors for two unisex restrooms. On the side of the porch is a large deep sink, with an adjacent wide wooden counter with a backboard, that overhangs and slants down toward the sink. From the restroom location, you can see fifteen shelters—three-sided wooden structures with grey shingled roofs. Each structure is shaped like a hexagon that has been cut in half, open on the side that faces the ocean. Each wall surface of the exterior of these shelters has a solid sheet of tan-colored siding. The interior walls are unfinished open frame construction. Mounted to one interior side wall is a metal box, about one foot high by two feet wide by one foot deep. Metal pegs and hooks on the walls are used to hang clothing and gear. A translucent fiberglass panel at the top of the back wall provides some natural light. Each shelter site has a picnic table located in or near the shelter. Tents are pitched in or near the shelters as well. The shelter sites are about 40 feet apart from each other. At the edge of the campground, on the downhill side, is a water station. This is a two and a half foot tall wooden post, with a pipe running up it to a faucet on top. Surrounding it on the ground is a wooden frame filled with rocks. The post has a water faucet, a small metal box screwed into its side. A wooden plaque with a sign that reads, Please help protect our wildlife. Please do not rinse dishes, brush teeth, or use soap at the water faucets. Please wash dishes at the large sink next to bathroom. Thank you."

Restroom is a beige metal building with privacy walls extending from the sides. Men’s room is to the left, women’s room to the right. A square concrete area extends from the center of the building about 15 feet. There is an approximately three inch step up to the concrete surface from the surrounding gravel. An overhang roof structure to the west of the restroom is over a dishwashing sink. The entire campground surface is gravel. To the right of the entrance is a public picnic area with three metal tables. To the left of the entrance are eight group tent sites. Four long rows of RV spaces are perpendicular to the entrance road. These spaces are designated by curbs and posts at the back, center of each site. About 20 tent-only spaces with metal picnic tables line the north border of the campground. No other spaces have tables, and there are no fire rings in the campground. The campground is surrounded by a wide expanse of rocky desert valley floor with short mesquite bushes. Tall mountains with sharply eroded canyons border the valley floor on all sides."

The entrance to the picnic area is located directly across from the entrance to Loop C. From the main road, continue straight past Loop C to Loop D which circles to the left and returns back to the main campground road across from Loop C. Campsites on the right side of the road on the farthest side of Loop D are situated next to the White River. A historic patrol cabin that has exhibits inside on the early use of a system of patrol cabins and the history of the round-the-mountain Wonderland Trail is to the right as you enter Loop D. The small amphitheater is located to the right just passed the patrol cabin. There are five restrooms. One restroom is located on the left side of the loop in Loop A, one is on the right near the entrance of Loop B, one is between the picnic area and Loop D, an accessible restroom is between Loop B and Loop C, and one is on the left side of Loop D across from the amphitheater. The Wonderland Trail runs through the campground and can be accessed to the right of the patrol cabin to head uphill toward Sunrise and next to the restroom in the picnic area to head south. Glacier Basin Trail is accessed across the road from the amphitheater or from the right side of farthest end of Loop D. The picnic area runs parallel to the road with parking spots on either side of the short picnic area road, picnic tables are on the far side of the picnic area from the road, a restroom is located to the right of the picnic tables, and a trail to access the river is accessed from the left end of the picnic tables."
